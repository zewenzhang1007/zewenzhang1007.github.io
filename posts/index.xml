      <description>In this post, I will focus on how I visualized three datasets about Malaria Death.
The first dataset is called malaria_deaths, it includes the data of Malaria deaths by country for all ages across the world and time. It has variables named as “Entity”, “Code”, “Year”, “Deaths - Malaria - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate) (per 100,000 people)”; “Code” refers to the country code, and I renamed the last one as “Death_Rate” for future convenience.</description>

      <description>Problem 1: Dice Game (Problem 205, solved by 14,219) Peter has nine four-sided (pyramidal) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4. Colin has six six-sided (cubic) dice, each with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Peter and Colin roll their dice and compare totals: the highest total wins. The result is a draw if the totals are equal. What is the probability that Pyramidal Pete beats Cubic Colin?</description>

      <description>The first moment that I saw the requirement of homework, which is designing my own website, I was really nervous: because I thought it would be extremely difficult for me to design a website within a week. But I realized it would be an interesting experience when I looked at the instruction of Hugo. I followed the steps, and I had fun playing with the theme &amp;mdash; Ananke. Ananke is one of the most widely used theme in Hugo, and it is also the theme used in the instruction.</description>
